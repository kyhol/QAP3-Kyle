Your name: Kyle Hollett
You are allowed to complete the assessment problems below in whatever way you can but please answer the following questions/points as part of your submission:



1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)

Answer: more than 20+ hours. I didn't record, but I have been working on it everyday since it dropped. 

2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)

youtube, w3schools, chatgpt, openAI, figma, stack overflow, oreillys 
3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)

Nope. 

4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?

Nope.

5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of Making this all! from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.

It felt easier than the last QAP we had. I could solve future problems with similar techniques but as always, more practice is needed. 

Thanks for everything Noman!
